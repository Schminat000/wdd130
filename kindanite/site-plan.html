      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Pitch: I work with computers often. I also play video games socially with my friends. We have a podcast in which we talk about a variety of topics in video games or current events. We need a way to advertise our content so that we can get a bigger audience which would help our content become more relevant to the internet. There are millions of different podcasts out there and having a website that would act as a central hub for our content would allow new listeners to find our content easier. Think about a business' website. Have you ever opened a web page for a company and not stuck around to purchase their product, because their website stunk? In a business model, you need a website that looks good; so, too, with anyone who wants people to find their content. I will build our podcast website.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience is those who are looking for a good time and entertainment. Those who really like to listen to podcasts and enjoy listening to the topics that my friends and I talk about. It is geared for those who are interested in similar things as us. It's really geared to those who enjoy listening to us be goofy for a hour or so and feel passionately about various topics.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home Page</h3>
      <p>
        Visitors will come for 3 main reasons, to leave comments and interact, to find podcasts links, and to read about current events and stay updated. There will be a total of 3 tabs for all of these actions at the top along with a main tab with information about us and our podcast. The main tab will have a short bio about each of us including fun facts. It will explain how we got started and give a short background on the podcast history.

      </ul>
      <h3>Previous Podcasts</h3>
      <p>
        This tab will have a link to all of our podcasts in historical order along with a short explanation of what each podcast is about. We will have our podcasts officially posted on Twitch and Youtube, but this will be a place to find all of the links and go back to find old ones. I want it to be very organized and clean looking so people can easily find what they are looking for.

      </ul>
      <h3>Recent News and Questions/Comments</h3>
      <p>
        This tab will have recent news events that we talk about and links to any articles or videos we reference. We want the people who listen to the podcast to be really engaged with what we are talking about. So if we mention something they want to learn more about we can post it here. This will be one way that we can keep people engaged with the podcast.
        Here will also be the questions and comments tab where people can personally interact with us and let us know what they want to hear about. We will take some time to reply to comments and maybe even mention some in our podcasts. We hope to also have good reviews here so people wondering about the podcast can hear good things about it. I hope to have a way to monitor the comments as well so people are not just able to post anything to our website.
