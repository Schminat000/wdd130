    <p>Hello! My wife and I got married in October and we don't have a baby yet but we do have a cat. This is my second semester at BYU-Idaho but I went to Utah State University for about a year and a half. I'll be graduating in April 2024 if all things go well. I am majoring in software engineering because I took a programming class and loved it. That's why I'm in this class, it's required of my major but it seems like a lot of fun. I am currently working for BYU-Idaho as an Assistant Network Engineer, I am still relatively new to it; however, it has been a blast learning how to troubleshoot network ports.</p>
    <p>I served a mission in the Japan, Fukuoka mission. I had a real tough time learning Japanese but man do I love it. I spent my whole mission on Okinawa and learned a little Okinawan as well. I even bought a Sanshin, it's an instrument that is similar to the banjo. My mission was cut short due to COVID-19 but I plan on going back to visit someday.</p>
    <p>Also, my wife and I have been on a Mario Kart 8 grind; so, if anyone is up for a challenge, we get competitive here.</p>
    <p>Here are some of the things that I like to do:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dungeons and Dragons</li>
        <li>Video games</li>
        <li>Sports</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are tons of things I like to do but these are probably the main few. I look forward to making websites look as pretty as your guys' and learning how to code that all out! Nice to meet you all and looking forward to getting to know y'all.</p>
